# Evidence-First Kernel Crash Workflow

This workflow turns a panic log or vmcore into a testable root-cause report. It
is intentionally stricter than a command cheat sheet: every conclusion must be
linked to preserved evidence, and every hypothesis must have a disproof test.

## 1. Analysis Contract

Before investigating, record these facts. If a fact is unknown, keep it marked
as unknown instead of guessing.

| Field | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Kernel release and full build string | Same release text can still refer to a different build |
| Architecture and platform | Register conventions, exception frames, and address translation differ |
| `vmlinux` path and GNU build ID | Establishes symbol provenance |
| vmcore path, size, checksum, and format | Detects truncation, replacement, and unsupported formats |
| Matching module `.ko` files and build IDs | An unloaded or out-of-tree module may contain the faulting instruction |
| Kernel command line and `.config` | Explains KASLR, sanitizers, watchdogs, preemption, and dump behavior |
| Taint flags | Identifies proprietary/out-of-tree modules, prior warnings, machine checks, and live patching |
| First observable anomaly | Later panics are often secondary damage |
| Reproduction trigger and last known-good version | Separates deterministic bugs from regressions and hardware faults |

Preserve raw artifacts before conversion or filtering:

```bash
sha256sum vmcore vmlinux > evidence.sha256
file vmcore vmlinux
readelf -n vmlinux | grep -F 'Build ID'
makedumpfile --dump-dmesg vmcore vmcore-dmesg.txt
```

Do not overwrite the original dump with a converted or filtered copy. Record
the `makedumpfile` filter level because excluded user, cache, or free pages can
make later memory queries inconclusive.

## 2. Evidence Hierarchy

Use the strongest available source first:

1. **vmcore + exact debuginfo + matching modules**: best for stateful,
   post-mortem analysis.
2. **Complete Oops/panic log**: often enough to locate the fault and classify
   the exception, but not to inspect arbitrary state.
3. **pstore/ramoops, serial console, netconsole, or BMC console**: vital when
   kdump never ran or the machine reset immediately.
4. **Watchdog, MCE/APEI/EDAC, and firmware records**: may be the only evidence
   for hard lockups and hardware-originated failures.
5. **Symptoms without a stack or timestamped log**: insufficient for a root
   cause. Improve capture before making a strong claim.

`vmcore-dmesg.txt` is worth collecting even when the full vmcore is incomplete:
the kernel ring buffer is normally written first and often retains the primary
failure signature.

## 3. Phase A — Validate Before Interpreting

### 3.1 Start with bounded triage

Agents must use the non-interactive wrapper:

```bash
./scripts/agent-crash.sh -k /path/to/vmlinux -c /path/to/vmcore triage
```

Human interactive equivalent:

```console
crash> sys
crash> log
crash> bt
crash> bt -a
crash> mod
```

Reject or downgrade the analysis if any of these checks fail:

- `sys` release/build does not match the supplied kernel artifacts.
- Symbols resolve to implausible functions or source lines.
- The faulting address belongs to a module whose matching `.ko` is absent.
- The dump is marked partial and the required address was filtered out.
- The log contains evidence of an earlier Oops, warning, MCE, or allocator
  corruption that precedes the final panic.

Load matching module symbols when required:

```console
crash> mod
crash> mod -s <module_name> /path/to/module.ko
```

### 3.2 Treat ARM64 `-m` parameters as a fallback

Modern kdump vmcores normally carry address-layout data in VMCOREINFO, which is
consumed by `crash` and `makedumpfile`. Try the standard invocation first:

```bash
crash vmlinux vmcore
```

Only derive `vabits_actual`, `phys_offset`, `kimage_voffset`, and `kaslr` when
the dump is raw RAM, VMCOREINFO is missing/damaged, or `crash` explicitly fails
address translation. See `arm64-crash-params.md` for that recovery path. Never
copy parameter values from another boot.

## 4. Phase B — Reconstruct the Failure Timeline

Read the log chronologically, not just its last screen. Build a short timeline:

```text
T-?     first warning / allocator report / MCE / hung-task report
T-Δ     workload or device event
T0      first Oops, BUG, lockup, or panic
T+Δ     secondary faults, recursive panic, kdump transition
```

Ask four questions:

1. What is the earliest abnormal event?
2. Which CPU/task first reported it?
3. Was the final panic deliberate (`panic_on_warn`, watchdog panic, SysRq-c,
   OOM panic) or caused by an unrecoverable exception?
4. Did another CPU or subsystem already report corruption?

The panic task is not automatically the culprit. It may be the first task to
touch memory corrupted earlier, the watchdog that noticed a stalled CPU, or the
OOM killer reacting to a long-running leak.

## 5. Phase C — Classify and Route

| Signature | First checks | Preferred next tool |
|---|---|---|
| NULL/near-NULL fault | Fault address, instruction operands, object lifetime | `bt -f`, `dis`, structure offsets |
| Wild pointer / poison value | Alloc/free history, slab cache, neighboring objects | KASAN, KFENCE, SLUB debug, page_owner |
| OOM / allocation failure | OOM log, zones, slabs, task RSS, fragmentation | `flow-oom`, `kmem`, page_owner |
| Soft lockup | Stuck CPU stack, scheduler progress, lock owner | `bt -a`, SysRq-l, ftrace |
| Hard lockup | NMI stack, interrupt state, firmware/BMC evidence | NMI watchdog, pstore, hardware logs |
| Hung task | All `UN` tasks, wait channel, completion/lock owner | `flow-deadlock`, SysRq-w, lockdep |
| Lock inversion | Earliest lockdep graph, held/acquired lock classes | lockdep, `flow-lockdown` |
| Data race | Two access sites, value transition, ordering primitive | KCSAN, targeted tracing |
| MCE/SError/APEI | Architecture syndrome plus hardware records | rasdaemon/EDAC/APEI/vendor tools |
| Regression | Good/bad kernel pair with same workload/config | upstream search, `git bisect` |

### 5.1 Exception and pointer faults

Use the exact faulting instruction, not merely the top C function:

```console
crash> bt -f
crash> bt -e
crash> dis -lr <function>
crash> struct <type> <address>
crash> kmem <address>
```

Map registers to the architecture ABI, calculate the effective address used by
the instruction, and verify the supposed object type with both its allocator
metadata and invariant fields. Compiler optimization and inlining can make a
source-line-only explanation wrong.

### 5.2 Hangs, lockups, and deadlocks

Soft lockup means kernel code failed to schedule for roughly
`2 * watchdog_thresh`; hard lockup means a CPU stopped servicing the watchdog
heartbeat. A hung task means a task remained blocked, usually in `D` state.
These are different failure modes and require different evidence.

Capture useful live state before forcing a dump when the machine still responds:

Writing `/proc/sysrq-trigger` changes a live host. Obtain explicit authorization
for the exact host and actions, confirm the output is being collected by an
access-controlled console/log path, and keep the sequence bounded. If that
authorization or capture path is unclear, provide these as operator steps only.

```bash
# all CPU backtraces, blocked tasks, held locks, memory state
echo l > /proc/sysrq-trigger
echo w > /proc/sysrq-trigger
echo d > /proc/sysrq-trigger
echo m > /proc/sysrq-trigger
```

The SysRq crash action deliberately panics the host. An agent must not execute
or automate it. Hand the final trigger to an authorized human using an approved
drill only after kdump, dump storage, out-of-band console access, workload
evacuation, and recovery procedures have all been verified.

### 5.3 Memory corruption and leaks

Choose instrumentation by environment and hypothesis:

- **Generic KASAN**: precise development-time OOB/UAF detection; high overhead.
- **SW_TAGS KASAN (ARM64)**: moderate-overhead testing on real workloads.
- **HW_TAGS KASAN (ARM64 MTE)**: low-overhead in-field detection or mitigation.
- **KFENCE**: sampled OOB/UAF/invalid-free detection with near-zero overhead;
  appropriate for long-running production fleets, but it may miss unsampled
  allocations.
- **Kmemleak**: finds possible orphan allocations; expect false positives and
  false negatives, and establish a clean baseline with `clear` then `scan`.
- **page_owner**: attributes page allocations and is especially useful when
  slab counters do not explain unreclaimable memory growth.

The tool that reports corruption found the detection point, which may not be
the instruction that first corrupted the object. Allocation and free stacks,
timestamps, and repeated reproductions are needed to close that gap.

### 5.4 Races and locking

KCSAN samples instrumented memory accesses and can report both racing stacks
and observed value changes. Reports with an unknown origin may indicate
uninstrumented code or DMA, so treat them as evidence of a race candidate, not
automatic proof of a specific second writer.

Lockdep proves properties about lock classes and dependency chains it has
observed. Preserve the earliest lockdep splat: after lock debugging disables
itself, later state is less useful. Confirm that the implicated lock classes
represent the intended object instances and are not annotation mistakes.

### 5.5 OOM and memory pressure

Distinguish these before declaring a leak:

- growing process RSS;
- growing reclaimable or unreclaimable slab;
- page allocation fragmentation despite free memory;
- pinned pages or unreclaimable page-cache state;
- cgroup-local OOM versus system-wide OOM;
- deliberate `panic_on_oom` versus a secondary failure.

Correlate the OOM log with `kmem -i`, `kmem -z`, `kmem -s`, `ps -G`, cgroup
limits, and longitudinal metrics. A single end-state snapshot rarely proves a
leak.

## 6. Tool Escalation Matrix

| Tool | Best use | Important limitation |
|---|---|---|
| `crash` | Broad post-mortem inspection and familiar kernel commands | Manual repetition is hard to audit |
| `drgn` | Repeatable Python analyses over live kernels or vmcores | Requires trustworthy symbols/types and carefully bounded scripts |
| GDB kernel helpers | Source/assembly inspection, selected lists/tasks | Not a replacement for crash-wide subsystem views |
| pstore/ramoops | Survives reboot when kdump or storage path fails | Small circular storage; plan record sizes and retention |
| ftrace/kprobes | Temporal evidence for a reproducible issue | Can perturb timing and generate large traces |
| KASAN | Precise memory safety reports | Build/runtime overhead varies substantially by mode |
| KFENCE | Long-running sampled production detection | Sampling trades coverage for low overhead |
| KCSAN | Data-race detection | Sampling and missing instrumentation can hide or obscure races |
| lockdep | Lock ordering and context validation | Needs debug config and only reasons over observed chains/classes |

Use `drgn -c /path/to/vmcore` when the same structure traversal must be rerun
across many dumps. Keep the script, its version, and its output with the case so
the finding is reproducible.

## 7. Phase D — Hypotheses, Disproof, and Confidence

Maintain a small hypothesis ledger:

| Hypothesis | Supporting evidence | Disproof test | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Example: object freed before callback | poison pattern; callback stack | inspect alloc/free stacks under KASAN/KFENCE | pending |

Rules:

1. Keep at least one competing explanation until direct evidence excludes it.
2. Separate **fault site**, **corruption site**, and **root cause**.
3. Label missing or filtered memory as `unknown`, not `zero` or `not present`.
4. Give confidence as high/medium/low and state what evidence would change it.
5. Do not claim an upstream commit is the fix solely because its title matches;
   compare the affected code path and reproduce on both sides when possible.

## 8. Phase E — Known Fix and Regression Verification

Build a search signature from stable facts:

```text
panic class + first non-generic function + subsystem + kernel version
```

Search upstream documentation, lore.kernel.org, subsystem trees, stable release
notes, and distribution errata. Build the smallest useful query before using an
external service: remove customer names, hostnames, filesystem paths, addresses,
credentials, and proprietary module identifiers unless disclosure is explicitly
approved. Prefer public function names, the panic class, subsystem, and kernel
version. For a suspected regression:

1. Reproduce on the newest supported/mainline kernel when practical.
2. Reconfirm the last known-good build with the same config and workload.
3. Remove proprietary/out-of-tree modules when possible and record taint.
4. Bisect only after the good/bad endpoints are reliable.
5. Validate a candidate fix by reverting or applying that exact change, not by
   assuming correlation from a version upgrade.
